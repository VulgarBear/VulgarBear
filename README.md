</p>

Welcome to my humble GitHub profile! I'm a network administrator by trade and looking to get my hands dirty in the coding world. I mainly do so as a hobby or for personal projects but I am also working towards making my life easier professionally as well. If any of my projects have peaked your interest feel free to grill me on my mistakes ðŸ˜„.
